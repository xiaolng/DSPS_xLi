CLARITY: The transparency of points is a great idea to differentiate overlaps. However at some points, it is difficult to differentiate points because of similar colors and size. 
What are the units for the sugar and acidity? In addition, the y-axis starts at 0 and the x-axis at 0.7 with little indication what is before them.

AESTHETIC: The colors are colorblind compliant with a neutral color being used as the base. The background is very useful along with the grid-lines. 
However, am unable to determine the alcohol content of the wines from relative area. 

HONESTY: There is little distortion except for alcohol content.
The wine quality scale is a little confusing and some information on the units of what is being measured
is lost, but besides that I think it is good.

Suggestions:
1. Use a color scale that utilizes two different colors so the transparency overlaps become more clear.

2. The only indicator for alcohol content is area and is ambiguous. I would suggest removing the alcohol percentage
if not needed or give some numerical indication related to length.

3. Rescale the axes so that they start consistently, so it is easy to tell which
values are what.

Quality: It was an interesting idea to represent the wine quality as a color which I thought
was nice. The color of the background with the color of the points are highly contrasting which makes them easy on the eye. 
The fonts and sizes of the letters and numbers are also easy to read.
